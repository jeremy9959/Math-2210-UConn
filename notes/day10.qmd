## Basis

A set of vectors in $\mathbf{R}^{n}$ (or in any vector space $V$) is called a **basis** if

- it spans $V$
- it is linearly independent.

Examples: if $A$ is an invertible $n\times n$ matrix,
its columns are linearly independent and span $\mathbf{R}^{n}$ and therefore are a basis for $\mathbf{R}^{n}$.

The vectors $1,x,x^2,\ldots, x^n$ span the polynomials of degree at most $n$ and are linearly indepenent.

The "standard vectors" $e_{i}$ for $i=1,\ldots, n$ are a basis for $\mathbf{R}^{n}$.

## Subspace basis

The vectors $(1,3,2)$ and $(-1,-1,0)$ are linearly indepedent and span a subspace $H$ of $\mathbf{R}^{3}$.  

Therefore they are a basis for $H$.

## Every spanning set contains a basis

If a set $S$ of vectors $v_1,\ldots, v_n$ spans a subspace $H$, then a subset of $S$ is a basis.

**Proof:** If the vectors are linearly indepenent, they are already a basis.

If they are dependent, then one is a linear combination of the others.  Remove that one from $S$. The result still spans.  

Continue removing dependent vectors until the remaining vectors are independent, and you've found your basis.

## A basis is a minimal spanning set 

If $H$ is a subspace of $V$, suppose you have a bunch of vectors in $H$.

Too many vectors makes them dependent.  To few means they can't span.  If they are a basis, there are enough to span, but not to become dependent. 

## Basis for $\mathrm{Nul}(A)$.

The null space of $A$ is spanned by the vectors with weights given by the free variables in the row reduced from of $A$.  

Those vectors are independent and therefore form a basis.



## Basis for $\mathrm{Col}(A)$.

Given vectors $v_1,\ldots, v_k$, make an $m\times k$
matrix with the $v_{i}$ as columns.

To find a linear relation among the columns of $A$, we need to solve $Ax=0$.  

But $Ax=0$ if and only if $EAx=0$ where $E$ is an elementary matrix.

Put another way, row reduction doesn't change the $x$ such that $Ax=0$. 

So we can assume $A$ is in row reduced echelon form.

## More on basis for $\mathrm{Col}(A)$. 

Once $A$ is in row reduced form, we see that:

- the columns corresponding to free variables are linear combinations of the pivot columns

- the pivot columns are linearly independent.

## Basis for $\mathrm{Col}(A)$.

The **columns of $A$** corresponding to the pivot columns in the row reduced version of $A$ are a basis for the column space.
(note that these are *not* the columns of the reduced matrix).

So: a basis for the null space is made up of $k$
vectors where $k$ is the number of free variables,
and a basis for the column space is made up of $r$
vectors where $r$ is the number of pivot columns.

Notice that $k+r=n$ where $n$ is the total number of columns of $A$.

## Example

Suppose that

$$
A=\left[\begin{matrix} 2 & 4 & 5& 1\\ 1 & -3 & -2& 0\\ 0 & -2 & -3 & 1\end{matrix}\right]
$$

The row reduced form of $A$ is
$$
\left[\begin{matrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1\\0 & 0 & 1 & -1\end{matrix}\right]
$$

Since the first three columns are pivot columns, the first three columns of $A$ span the column space of $A$, and the last column satisfies $c_4 = c_1+c_2-c_3$.

## Example continued

The nullspace of $A$ is the solution to the homogeneous system, and it is given by
the equations 
$$\begin{array}{ccc}
x_1 &=&-x_4 \\
x_2 &=& -x_4 \\
x_3 &=& x_4
\end{array}
$$

so the null space is spanned by 
$$
\left[\begin{matrix} -1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \\ 1\end{matrix}\right]
$$

## Null Space and Col Space

## Row space

The *row space* of a matrix is the span of its rows.  

Row operations do not change
the row space, so one can find a basis for the row space of $A$ by putting $A$ in reduced form.

The rows with a pivot (that is, the nonzero rows) form a basis for the row space. 

This is because they are clearly linearly independent (and they span by definition).


## Linear Transformations

A linear transformation (or linear map) $T:V\to W$, where $V$ and $W$ are vector spaces,
is a function that satisfies $T(u+v)=T(u)+T(v)$ and $T(cv)=cT(v)$ for all $u,v\in V$ and $c\in\mathbf{R}$.

The *kernel* of a linear transformation is the set of vectors that map to zero:
$$
\mathrm{kernel}(T)=\{x\in V: T(x)=0\bar}$$

The *range* or *image* of a linear transformation is the set of vectors $w\in W$
such that there is a $v\in V$ with $T(v)=w$. 

## Coordinate systems

**Unique representation:**
Suppose that $B=\{b_1,\ldots, b_n\}$ are a basis for a vector space $V$.  Then any vector $v$
can be written in exactly one way as a linear combination of the $b_{i}$:
$$
v = c_1 b_1+\ldots+c_n b_n
$$

The coefficients $c_1,\ldots, c_n$ are called the *coordinates* of $v$ relative to the basis $B$. 

The vector
$$
\left[\begin{matrix} c_1 \\ \vdots \\ c_n\end{matrix}\right]
$$
is called the *coordinate vector* for $v$ relative to $B$.
