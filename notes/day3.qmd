matrix x vector multiplication
matrix equations Ax=b
corresponds to linear combinations of columns
Has a solution if b is in span of columns of A
When does Ax=b have a solution for every b?
relationship between pivots in the augmented matrix and consistency

Solution sets of homogeneous equations
has a nontrivial solution of there is a free variable
solution set is the span of a set of vectors
solutions can be written parametrically

Nonhomogeneous systems

Ax=b where b isn't zero
solution has form u + variable vectors
variable vectors correspond to free variables
- row reduce augmented matrix
- write the basic variables in terms of the free ones
- write a typical solution in terms of the free variables if any
- interpret as vectors

Example: chemical equations

aC3H8 + bO2 -> cCO2 + dH2O

what are the weights? this is a system of linear equations

Linear independence

definition
dependence -- one is a combination of others

if p>n, then p vectors in R^n are dependent

## Matrix Equations

A system of $n$ linear equations in $k$ unknowns can be written in matrix form
$$
Ax = b
$$

Here $A$ is the $n\times k$ matrix of coefficients
$$
A = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & \cdots& a_{1k} \\
\vdots &\vdots & \vdots \\
a_{n1} & \cdots & a_{nk} \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$


## Matrix multiplication


The vectors $x$ and $b$ are
$$
x = \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n\end{pmatrix}, b = \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\\vdots\\b_n\end{pmatrix}
$$

The matrix product $Ax$ is *by definition* the linear combination of the columns of $A$ with weights given by $x$.

## Matrix Multiplication

$$
\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 & 2\\2 & 4 & 1\\ -1 & -1 & 0\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\2\\3\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}13 \\13 \\-3\end{pmatrix}
$$

$$
\begin{pmatrix} 13 \\ 13 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -1\end{pmatrix} + 2\begin{pmatrix}3 \\4 \\-1\end{pmatrix} + 3\begin{pmatrix} 2\\1\\0\end{pmatrix}
$$

**Important:** In general a matrix equation $Ax=b$ has a solution $x$ if $b$ is in the span of the columns of $A$.

## Solving a matrix equation

Given the matrix equation $Mx=b$, to solve it,
use row reduction on the augmented matrix 
$[M b]$.

For M and b as above the augmented matrix is
```{python}
from sympy import Matrix
M = Matrix([[1,3,2,13],[2,4,1,13],[-1,-1,0,-3]])
M 
```

Applying row reduction yields
```{python}
M.rref()[0]
```

This gives $x_1=1,x_2=2,x_3=3$ as the only solution to this equation.

## Another example

Consider the following $M$ and $b$.

```{python}
M = Matrix([[3,5,-4],[-3,-2,4],[6,1,-8]])
M 
```
```{python}
b = Matrix([[7],[-1],[-4]])
b 
```

### Augmented form
```{python}
Maug=Matrix([[3,5,-4,7],[-3,-2,4,-1],[6,1,-8,-4]])
Maug
```

## Example continued

### Reduced form

```{python}
Maug.rref()[0]
```

### Solution
$x_3$ is a free variable. 

$$\begin{matrix}
x_2 &=& 2 \\
x_1 &=& -1-\frac{4}{3} x_3\\
\end{matrix}
$$

## Vector form

$$
x = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 0\end{pmatrix} + x_3\begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4}{3} \\ 0 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}
$$

## Inconsistency

A system is  inconsistent if the only non zero entry in a row occurs by itself in the last column. Consider $Mx=b$.

### Matrix M
```{python}
M = Matrix([[1,2,3],[0,1,1],[1,1,2]])
b = Matrix([[1],[1],[1]])
M
```

### Vector b
```{python}
b 
```

## Iconsistency example
Reduced form - last row shows inconsistent.
```{python}
M=Matrix([[1,2,3,1],[0,1,1,1],[1,1,2,1]])
M.rref()[0]
```

## Homogeneous Systems

A *homogeneous system* is a matrix equation $Ax=b$ where the target vector $b$ is zero.

The solutions are parameterized by $s$ vectors,
where $s$ is the number of free variables in the reduced matrix $A$.

The values of the variables corresponding to pivots are determined by the free variables.

If there are no free variables, the only solution to the inhomogeneous system is zero.
