## Elementary Matrices

An elementary matrix is obtained by doing a single row operation on the identity matrix.  

There are three types.

## Elementary Matrices - Permutations

Suppose

$$
I = \left[\begin{matrix} 1 & 0 & 0 &\cdots & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 &\cdots & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \ddots & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 &\cdots & 1\end{matrix}\right]
$$

Switch the first and third rows (for example) and you get

$$
I = \left[\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 1 &\cdots & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 &\cdots & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \ddots & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 &\cdots & 1\end{matrix}\right]
$$

## Elementary Matrices - Permutations

If $E$ is the elementary matrix obtained from $I_n$
by swapping rows $i$ and $j$, and $A$ is an $n\times m$ matrix, then $EA$ is obtained from $A$ by swapping rows $i$ and $j$. 

Such an $E$ is an invertible matrix. 

## Elementary Matrices - scaling

If $E$ is the elementary matrix obtained from $I_{n}$ by multiplying row $i$ by $a$, and $A$ is any $n\times m$ matrix, then $EA$ is obtained from $A$ by scaling row $i$ by $a$.

Such an $E$ is an invertible matrix.

## Elementary Matrices - adding

If $E$ is the elementary matrix obtained from $I_{n}$ by replacing row $i$ by the sum of row $i$ and row $j$, and $A$ is any $n\times m$ matrix, then $EA$ is the matrix obtained from $A$ by adding rows $i$ and $j$.

Such an $E$ is an invertible matrix. 

## Theorem on elementary matrices

If $A$ is an $n\times m$ matrix, there is a sequence of elementary matrices $E_{1},\ldots, E_{k}$ so that
$$
E_{k}\cdots E_{2}E_{1}A
$$

is in row reduced echelon from.

If $A$ is a square $n\times n$ matrix, then its row reduced form has only diagonal entries.  

## Invertible matrices

If the rref of a square matrix $A$ has pivots in every column then $A$ is invertible.

$$
E_{k}\cdots E_{2}E_{1}A = I_{n}
$$

so 

$$
A^{-1} = E_{1}^{-1}E_{2}^{-1}\cdots E_{k}^{-1}
$$

## Invertible matrices

If the rref does *not* have a pivot in every column, then it is not invertible.   Because in that case there is a vector $v$ which is not zero such that 

$$
E_{k}\cdots E_{2}E_{1}Av=0
$$

so $Av=0$.  But if $A$ were invertible then $A^{-1}Av=0$ implies $v=0$, which is  not true. 

## Computing the inverse

You can compute the inverse matrix of an $n\times n$ square matrix $A$ by finding the RREF of the $n\times 2n$ matrix

$$
\left[\begin{matrix} A & I_{n}\end{matrix}\right]
$$
