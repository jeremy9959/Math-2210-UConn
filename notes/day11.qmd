## Dimension

**Theorem:** Suppose $B=\{b_1,\ldots, b_n\}$ is a basis for a vector space $V$. Then
any set $u_1,\ldots, u_m$ of $n+1$ or more vectors is linearly dependent.

**Proof:** Write each $u_i$ in coordinates using $b_i$.  There are $n$ coordinates $[u_i]_B$ for each $i$,
and $m>n$ such coordinate vectors, so these coordinate vectors are linearly dependent. 

More explicitly, since $B$ spans, we can write:
$$\begin{array}{ccc}
u_1 &=& a_{11} b_1 + a_{12}b_2 +\cdots + a_{1n}b_n\\
&\vdots& \\
u_m &=& a_{m1} b_1 + a_{m2}b_2 + \cdots + a_{mn}b_n
\end{array}
$$

## Dimension continued 

Our goal is to find a non trivial solution to $\sum_{j=1}^{m} c_j u_j = 0$. The coefficient of $b_i$
in this linear combination is 
$$
\sum_{j=1}^{m} c_j a_{ji}.
$$
Since the $b_i$ are linearly independent, we must have
$$
\sum_{j=1}^{m} c_j a_{ji}=0
$$
for each $i$.  

This is a homogeneous linear system of $n$ equations in $m$ unknowns where $m>n$.  Thus it must have a nontrivial
solution.


## Dimension 

**Theorem:** If $V$ has a basis $B$  with $n$ vectors, then every basis of $V$ has $n$ vectors. 

**Proof:** If $B'$ is another basis, it must have $n$ or fewer elements, because if it had more than $n$ it would
be linearly dependent.  If it had fewer than $n$, then the original basis $B$ would be dependent.  So the only possibility
is that $B'$ also has $n$ elements.

**Definition:** If $V$ has a finite basis, it is called finite dimensional and the dimension of $V$ is the number of elements in a finite basis.  Otherwise we say $V$ is infinite
dimensional.

## Dimension of subspaces

If $H$ is a subspace of a finite dimensional space $V$, then the dimension of $H$ is at most that of $V$; if they have the same dimension, then $H=V$.

Also:

- Any linearly independent subset of a vector space $H$ can be extended to a basis.  (Assume $H$ finite dimensional)

- Any spanning set contains a basis. 

## Construction of a basis

Suppose $b_1,\ldots, b_k$ are linearly independent in a vector space $V$.  Either they span $V$, in which case they are already a basis,
or they don't span $V$.

If they don't span $V$ there is a $b_{k+1}$ in $V$ that is not in the span of the $b_i$ for $i\le k$.  Then $b_1, \ldots, b_{k+1}$ is still
linearly independent.  

If $V$ is finite dimensional of dimension $n$, this process cannot continue indefinitely because once you have $n$ linearly independent vectors you have a basis.  

## Every (finite) spanning set contains a basis

Suppose $B$ is a (finite) set of vectors that span $V$.  If $B$ is linearly independent, it is already a basis.  If not, then one vector in $B$ is dependent on the others, so you can delete it and the remaining vectors still span.

Repeating this process reduces the size of the set of spanning vectors; eventually this has to reach a basis.

## Example

Suppose that 
$$
H=\left\{\left[\begin{matrix}s-2t \\ s+t \\3t\end{matrix}\right]:s,t\in\mathbf{R}\right\} 
$$

What is the dimension of this space?  Find a basis.

We can rewrite this as
$$
H=\{s\left[\begin{matrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0\end{matrix}\right] + t\left[\begin{matrix} -2 \\ 1 \\ 3\end{matrix}\right]: s,t\in \mathbf{R}\} 
$$
so $H$ is spanned by the two given vectors.

Since they are linearly independent (look at the last entry) the dimension of $H$ is $2$.

## Example

The polynomials $1$, $2t$, $4t^2-2$ and $8t^3-12t$ are called the first four Hermite polynomials.  They come up in the solution of certain differential equations.

Show that they form a basis for the polynomials of degree $3$, so every such polynomial has a unique expansion in terms of the Hermite polynomials. 

## Example

Relative to the basis $1,t,t^2, t^3$ the Hermite polynomials have coordinate vectors
$$
\left[\begin{matrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{matrix}\right],
\left[\begin{matrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{matrix}\right],
\left[\begin{matrix} -2 \\ 0 \\ 4 \\ 0\end{matrix}\right],
\left[\begin{matrix} 0 \\ -12 \\ 0 \\ 8\end{matrix}\right]
$$

These are four vectors in a four dimensional space, so they are a basis if they are linearly independent.  Check this -- note that the associated matrix is already upper triangular.
