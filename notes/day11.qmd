## Dimension

**Theorem:** Suppose $B=\{b_1,\ldots, b_n\}$ is a basis for a vector space $V$. Then
any set $u_1,\ldots, u_m$ of $n+1$ or more vectors is linearly dependent.

**Proof:** Write each $u_i$ in coordinates using $b_i$.  There are $n$ coordinates $[u_i]_B$ for each $i$,
and $m>n$ such coordinate vectors, so these coordinate vectors are linearly dependent. 


Therefore there are 
constants:
$$
a_1 [u_1]_B +\cdots + a_m[u_m]_B=0
$$
where not all $a_i$ are zero.  That means that the coordinate vector of
$$
h=a_1 u_1 + \cdots + a_m u_m
$$

is zero, which means $h$ is zero.  So the $u_i$ are dependent. 




## Dimension 

**Theorem:** If $V$ has a basis$B$  with $n$ vectors, then every basis of $V$ has $n$ vectors. 

**Proof:** If $B'$ is another basis, it must have $n$ or fewer elements, because if it had more than $n$ it would
be linearly dependent.  If it had fewer than $n$, then the original basis $B$ would be dependent.  So the only possibility
is that $B'$ also has $n$ elements.

**Definition:** If $V$ has a finite basis, it is called finite dimensional and the dimension of $V$ is the number of elements in a finite basis.  Otherwise we say $V$ is infinite
dimensional.

## Dimension of subspaces

If $H$ is a subspace of a finite dimensional space $V$, then the dimension of $H$ is at most that of $V$; if they have the same dimension, then $H=V$.

Also:

- Any linearly independent subset of a vector space $H$ can be extended to a basis.  

- Any spanning set contains a basis.
