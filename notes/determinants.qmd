## The determinant as a linear function

Suppose that $A$ is an $n\times n$ matrix whose $i^{th}$ row
is of the form $u+kv$ where $u$ and $v$ are vectors and $k$ is a constant:

$$
A = \left[\begin{matrix} A_1 \\ A_2 \\ \vdots \\ u+kv \\ \vdots \\A_{n}\end{matrix}\right]
$$

Here $A_1,A_2,\ldots$ are the rows of $A$ with $A_{i} = u+kv$.  

## Linearity of the determinant

Then 
$$
\det A = \det \left[\begin{matrix} A_1 \\ A_2 \\ \vdots \\ u \\ \vdots \\A_{n}\end{matrix}\right]
+ k\det\left[\begin{matrix} A_1 \\ A_2 \\ \vdots \\ v \\ \vdots \\A_{n}\end{matrix}\right]
$$

This is sometimes expressed by saying that the determinant is a linear function of each row (holding the others fixed).
